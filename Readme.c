📚 Libft - 42 Project
Libft is a foundational project at 42 School that consists of recreating a custom C standard library. 
The goal is to implement essential functions from <stdlib.h>, <string.h>, and <ctype.h>, as well as additional utility functions to improve programming efficiency.

🏆 Objectives
Gain a deeper understanding of C programming and memory management.
Implement common standard library functions from scratch.
Create a personal library that can be reused in future projects.
Improve skills in pointers, structures, and function optimization.

📌 Project Details
Reimplement functions such as:
Memory functions: malloc, free, memcpy, memset, etc.
String manipulation: strdup, strlen, strjoin, strtrim, etc.
Character checks: isalpha, isdigit, isalnum, etc.
Linked list utilities (optional): lstnew, lstadd_back, lstiter, etc.
The library must be efficient, modular, and norm-compliant.

⚙️ Technologies
C programming
Dynamic memory management
Pointer arithmetic
Data structures (linked lists)

This project is an excellent introduction to low-level programming and helps build a strong coding foundation for future projects at 42.
